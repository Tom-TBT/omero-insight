Contributing to OMERO.insight
=============================

.. note:: See the :devs_doc:`Contributing Developer <>` documentation for more 
    information about contributing to OME projects in general.

Getting started with OMERO.insight
----------------------------------

Getting started with OMERO.insight entails that you have an
:doc:`OMERO.server </sysadmins/server-overview>` already deployed.

Installing from source
----------------------

Since January 2011, the OMERO.insight code base is part of the OMERO code
base. See :doc:`/developers/installation`, to check out code using
http://git.openmicroscopy.org.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Install a Java 7+ Development Kit (JDK), available from
   `Java SE Downloads 
   <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_ and
   required for both the OMERO server and client code. Set the ``JAVA_HOME``
   environment variable to your JDK installation.

Running code
^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is helpful to set up the project in `Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org>`_.
Because the OMERO Java and Python source files are encoded in UTF-8, ensure
that the encoding in Eclipse
(:menuselection:`Preferences --> General --> Workspace --> Text file encoding`)
is also set to UTF-8.

Build system
^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :doc:`/developers/build-system` for details.

The OME project currently uses Jenkins_ (formerly known as hudson) as a
continuous integration server available :jenkins:`here <>`. OMERO.insight is
built as part of the "OMERO" jobs. See the
:devs_doc:`contributing developer continuous integration </ci-omero.html>`
documentation for full details.
