==================

.. note:: With the release of OMERO 5.3.0, the OMERO.insight desktop client
    has entered **maintenance mode**, meaning it will only be updated if a
    major bug is discovered. Instead, the OME team will be focusing on
    developing the web clients. As a result, coding against this client is no
    longer recommended.

The repository of the software artifacts is organized as follows:

-  ``config``: Various configuration files required by the application
   to run.

-  ``src``: Contains the application source files.

-  ``test``: The test code.

-  ``README``: The README file.
