Finding log file
----------------

Go to the OMERO.insight Help menu and select Show Log File.
This will show you the location of the log file - omeroinsight.log.
If there are other log files with _1 or _2 appended to the name, ignore them.
Alternatively you can find the log file in your user folder:
 - Windows: ``C:\Users\you\omero\log\omeroinsight.log``
 - Mac: ``/Users/you/omero/log/omeroinsight.log``

Submitting files
----------------

If an error occurred during import you can upload the files using the submission dialog.
Automatic uploading of files to OME QA will not work if the file size is greater than 2GB.
Submission of smaller file sizes can also not work if you are uploading over a slow or
unreliable network. If the file upload to OME QA fails, please contact the team using our
[support page](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/support/) to discuss alternative mechanism to submit the files.
